I am a computer programmer by trade and use Python almost exclusively to make my living. An experienced Software Engineer with a passion for Machine Learning and Data Science.

I can help you on your journey to become a professional Software Developer or Machine Learning Engineer. I've recently started blogging about tech; I'll be writing about my learning journey, and mostly Python tutorials.

If you have any questions, feedback, or comments, just shoot me a message! I am happy to talk to you ðŸ™‚
